# SmartCLIDE at Eclipse Research Labs

Eclipse Research Labs is a place where the [Eclipse Research](https://www.eclipse.org/org/research/) community can come together to collaborate in open source.

Eclipse Research Labs operates at "arms length" from the Eclipse Foundation: Eclipse Research Labs projects are not official Eclipse Foundation projects, they are not officially hosted or supported by the Eclipse Foundation, and do not necessarily follow the Eclipse Foundation development and intellectual property policies. 

Eclipse Research Labs projects may eventually become official Eclipse open source projects in whole or in part; with this in mind, we recommend the use of the [Eclipse Public License](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/) and that all contributors sign the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php).

There are a number of things Eclipse Labs projects cannot include the word Eclipse in their name, or use the org.eclipse namespace.
